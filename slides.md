&mdash;Billy Joel


# we make superpowers.

# the tech stack you're using is likely "wrong"


# the team you're on is likely "wrong"


## the country, political, & economic system you're in are likely
# "wrong"

<pre><code>08:42 < dominictarr> it's like that in sailing too
08:42 < dominictarr> the boat will outlast you
08:42 < dominictarr> you have to plan to control your fatigue</code></pre>


## act IV
# the getaway


<blockquote>"I'm not afraid to compete. It's just the opposite. Dont you see that? I'm afraid I *will* compete - that's what scares me. ... Just because I'm so horribly conditioned to accept everybody else's values, and just because I like applause and people to rave about me, doesn't make it right."</blockquote>

&mdash;Salinger, *Franny &amp; Zooey*


# principles
## not opinions

we make systems.


our systems affect the real world.


we are the scarcity


we have as much power as we can recognize


# obligatory code
<pre><code>var h = require('hoarders')
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
'real programmers dont use comments'</code></pre>


# thank you
## for your consideration
